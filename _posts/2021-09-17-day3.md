# Dance

A hobby is something that people do in their free time, something they want to do for themself.    
One thing that I always make and have time for is dance. 
Dance is something that keeps me feel lively in this 9-5 lifestyle.
Once upon a time, it was a hard core passion to be a good dancer, however now it is one source that keeps me fit and brings joy in a boring dull day.

Dance as a hobby is not about the activity that I do, but it is more about enjoying the time and also putting emotions into it.
Not every day is good, there are times when I feel low and offbeat. Dance helps me to channelize my emotion. 
Dancing on heavy metal music lifts up my spirit, the flow of that particular day is extraordinary.
In my opinion, expressing emotion through a meaningful song is an art.
Dancing is my way of escaping from this worldly negativity.
There are quite a few things that make me upset in the current world, dance to me is an escape from this.
dance is like feeling my soul.
Dance is happiness
Dance is fitness.
