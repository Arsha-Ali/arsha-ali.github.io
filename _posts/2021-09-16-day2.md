# # Mobile and Earbuds

It's a common thing basic necessity for people in today's world. However, I'm kinda more attached to my Mobile and earbuds. 

# # Special

There is one point in everyone's life where you become financially independent, I have achieved my independence the hard way.
To remember and celebrate my hard work, patience, and independence I have gifted myself with the mobile I have eyed the most and the trending pair of earbuds.
People do carry/use them as per their requirement, but I for one use them like 24*7 all day all long all night.
It keeps me in the race of this world by managing my schedule, quick updates of the latest news.
Helps me keep track of my health, finance, not soo boring family events, and other important dates.
What could be more innovative than a device that makes your life and works easy just with few clicks
 
I have my earbuds plugged in all day long, I sleep with my buds hearing lovely retro music.
My usage of mobile and earbuds have earned them the name of Kavach Kundal like the one Lord Karn had, I'm an incomplete person without them.
