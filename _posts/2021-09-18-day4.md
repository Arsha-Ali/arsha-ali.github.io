Education is a basic necessity for everyone in today's life. It makes you a better person, smart and differentiates you from other living beings.

In a country like India education is still a luxury, not a necessity. We are a country with never-ending poverty and unemployment.

To overcome this situation and be a developed nation every single person must have an opportunity to get primary education.

It reforms you into a better person who is self-sufficient, helps you make wise decisions.
It brings numerous job opportunities and makes you independent.

The government has brought up many schemes & programs for children's education along with this we also need to play out part in creating an awareness in people about how important it is to have their children educated.

In our nation, it is still a dream of many parents to have their children educated.
Every individual should take the responsibility of spreading awareness and help in every way possible to have our future generation educated.
