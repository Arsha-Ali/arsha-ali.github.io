# Shopping

Shopping has become a part of our lifestyle. Before the online market, the concept of shopping was way different.
People have changed their style of shopping over the years.
Online buying is the new trend however surprisingly most online buyers are GenX folks.
The young generation/ millennials are the natives of online shopping but statistics have shown that 65% of online buyers are GenX
It has been a key to survival in this pandemic situation.

Better prices, more variety easy comparison, and no sales pressure are the advantages of online shopping.
I mean who wouldn't like to stay in the comfort zone and get things at the doorstep.
I am not a shopping person, I find it very difficult to go check on stuff and purchase. It feels like a waste of time and energy. Online shopping has improved my shopping skills because I'm now a super buyer of online products.

It has its disadvantages of frauds and non-reliable products however we always have an easy return option where we can return the product if we are not satisfied.
