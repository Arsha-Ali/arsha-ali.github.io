# THOR

Thor Odinson is the God of Thunder and the warrior prince of Asgard. He is one of the Marvel Heros and the protector of earth.
He is known for strength and Mystic enchanted hammer Mjolnir.
He has superhuman strength, speed, and immunity.
People also say that he was considered to be a God in Roman Empire.

Thor has been my all-time favorite character from Marvel Heros. His strength and attitude of not giving up on things easily fascinate me the most.
I hardly read books but Marvel comics are one cherished memory of my childhood.
Superheroes and power rangers are my thing, if it were real, if it were to exist in the real world I would have had a serious plan to become a Super Hero.

"I CHOOSE TO RUN TOWARDS MY PROBLEMS AND NOT AWAY FROM THEM. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HEROES DO". This is the line that inspired me the most.
I always told myself I will have to deal with my issues, running away will not solve the problems.
I always motivate myself by saying, your fav Super Hero does not fear problems you should be doing the same.
